\subsection{History}
vcLABs was founded by two graduates of University of Moratuwa, Pubudu Madhawa and Sagara Wijeweera on April 2, 2015. Madhawa followed Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering while Sagara graduated in Electrical Engineering. But they both were interested in computer science.

Around 2015, Sri Lankan government put forward a new legislation to protect the Sri Lankan producers. Airing foreign advertisements without proper monetization in Sri Lanka was forbidden under that legislation . So, DialogTV which is a popular satellite TV provider in Sri Lanka had to take immediate action to remove foreign ads from the channels they provide. Most of the time, the advertisements were Indian ads and it was reported that the products that was "freely" advertised were exported to Sri Lanka, directly exploiting the existing system. So DialogTV approached the scenario with a manual ad replacement system which replaced foreign ads with local ads which in turn created a extra revenue to DialogTV. The manual system was not due to some reasons. Some main reasons are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cost of the person who replace the ads
\item Cost for equipment which are specially required for manual system
\end{itemize}

So meantime, DialogTV researched for an automated system that performs the current ad replacement. They were not able to find such system. This is where Madhawa and Sagara comes up with a state of the art automated ad replacement system which even exceeded DialogTV's expectations. So this ad replacement system can be considered as world's first commercially used such a system.

Eventually Madhawa and Sagara decided to start up their own company in order to pioneer AI research in Sri Lanka. They named it Visual Concept Labs (or vcLABs).
 

\subsection{Company Logo}
Figure \ref{fig:logo} is the logo of vcLABs. It primarily depicts the idea "visual concepts". We perceive color and geometry as humans. It is the primary motivation behind the logo.

\section{vcLABs; Functions and Products}
\subsection{Colombo Chapter}
The core product in Colombo chapter is the ad replacement system which is functional in DialogTV. Currently the sole client in Colombo chapter is DialogTV. Dr. Madhawa and Eng. Sagara oversees the performance of the chapter from USA and Australia. The core product, the ad replacement system comprises of three parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Advertisement Detection Tool: This tool detects foreign ads. Currently this system can handle a database of more than 100000 ads.
\item Advertisement Monitoring tool: This tool monitors the advertisement detection tool
\item Advertisement Insertion tool: This tool is responsible of insertion of local ads to the up stream. This tool performs dynamically minimizing removal of programs with buffering capability.
\end{itemize}

Other than the core product, the Colombo chapter is currently in the process of developing a novel system that would revolutionize ad market that comprises of retrieving and scheduling ads directly, without the intervention of an advertising agency as such.

\subsection{USA Branch}
USA branch which is solely led by Dr. Madhawa operates in a novel business model. It is mostly research led and has a researcher-network and make collaborations possible when they are available. The relationship between a researcher and the company is of four kinds:

\begin{itemize}
\item IP: The company shares the IP rights with the researcher(s)
\item Patents: The company shares the patents with the researcher(s)
\item Public: The research is published to the general public
\item Trade Secret: The research is kept as a trade secret by the company. A royalty is negotiated between the company and researchers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Australia Branch}
Australia branch is led by the Chief Architect Eng. Sagara.Although Research in Australia branch is not as prominent factor as in USA branch, Australia branch is more directed toward software development and maintenance.
