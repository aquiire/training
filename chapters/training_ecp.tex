I was recruited as a software engineering intern to vcLABs with two of my colleagues of University of Moratuwa, Heshan Fernando and Vidura Sumanasena. We were assigned to improve the current ad detection system.

\section{Tasks Assigned}
The main problem that vcLABs ad detection tool had was the inter-channel ad detection. The tool works perfectly when it comes to detecting ads which are trained from the same channel (intra-channel ad detection). But if it were to detect an ad for which its hash was generated from another channel, it was not able to detect that ad most of the time. Our first task was to create a channel agnostic algorithm for ad detection. We were not explained the existing detection algorithm because it would constrain our ideas. But guidance was given during the tasks by Dr. Madhawa and our supervisors.

I participated in mainly 3 tasks.

\begin{itemize}
\item Developing my own algorithm to compare videos
\item Investigating the potential of using Single-shot Multi-box Detector (SSD) model to ad detection in collaboration with one of my colleagues (Heshan Fernando)
\item Investigating the potential of using Siamese architecture to detect ads in collaboration with Heshan Fernando
\end{itemize}

\section{Environments Used}
The existing algorithm was coded in c++. As we were expected to familiarize with the current system architecture, we were given some time to get to to know the environment. The input device to the workstation that runs the system was a Decklink SDI 4K card.

\end{figure} 

Decklink SDI 4K card inputs the downstream from the satellite in SDI format which consists raw video and audio data. This card has its own API, with a detailed documentation. I had never referred an API before for development purposes so this was a learning experience for me.

The company used Visual Studio 2013 in their projects so we were encouraged to use it for our projects.

\end{figure}

I wasn't familiar with visual studio before, so there was a learning curve on learning visual studio and c++. 

In addition to Visual Studio, I used \texttt{python} in machine learning tasks as it is currently the leading programming language in machine learning and AI. \texttt{Tensorflow}, \texttt{keras} and \texttt{matplotlib} were the most used modules. In addition I was able to familiarize with \texttt{conda environments} and \texttt{python package manager} called \texttt{pip}.

Most the developments related to machine learning was done on an \texttt{Ubuntu} machine. Meanwhile, I was able to get to know about some basic terminal tasks like activating python environments, using terminal editors like vim, source control using git, etc.

\end{figure}

Seldom I had to use \texttt{docker images} to work with \texttt{caffe}, \texttt{Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)}, \texttt{scikit-learn} in order to get some idea about machine learning frameworks.

\section{Familiarization Programs}
In order to be familiar with Visual Studio Environment, my former supervisor assigned me to develop a simple video player make using \texttt{opencv} in \texttt{c++}. I had to spend almost a week to get \texttt{opencv} working in the Visual Studio Environment. I was given some \texttt{c++} tutorials to follow along with some simple \texttt{opencv} tutorials, ranging from opening an image to detection of an object via a webcam using simple HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value) color-space segmentation.

In the first month we were given a rough idea about the system that is operational in DialogTV without going into details as mentioned before.
